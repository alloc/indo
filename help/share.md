  <bold>indo share</bold><gray> - Share vendor packages with git</gray>

Vendor packages can be added to <yellow>"repos"</yellow> in `.indo.json` which allows you
to share them with other developers via git. All they need to do is run
`git pull && indo` and shared packages are automatically cloned.
